Concept:
A racing game that takes place in a retro futuristic city with retro as well as futuristic cars and different types of events.

Lore/Story:
Welcome to Neon Olympus, where the old-fashioned classic cars get more love than a vintage vinyl record at a hipster cafe. In this city of sleek, futuristic skyscrapers and neon-lit streets, there's a nostalgic charm to be found in the rumble of a V8 engine and the gleam of chrome accents.
While hover cars may be the talk of the town, it's the timeless beauty of classic automobiles that steals the spotlight here. From the iconic cars of the 1960s to the elegant exotic cruisers of the 1970s, Neon Olympus is a paradise for collectors and enthusiasts who appreciate the craftsmanship and heritage of a bygone era as well as improving the classics with a little futuristic touch.
After arriving at this paradise, you encounter a group of racers, “The Neon Velocity Vanguard” who challenge you to a race in their all blacked out 90s sedans .
After dominating the competition in a slow car, you are further invited to a time trial but only after using a better car,after dominating even that, the demo ends after beating the drift trial with the chosen car made for drifting.
